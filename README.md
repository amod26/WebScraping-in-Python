# WebScraping-in-Python
Web scraping is an automatic process of extracting information from web. Web scraping, also called web data mining or web harvesting, is the process of constructing an agent which can extract, parse, download and organize useful information from the web automatically. In other words, we can say that instead of manually saving the data from websites, the web scraping software will automatically load and extract data from multiple websites as per our requirement.

Working of a web scraper:
Step 1: Downloading Contents from Web Pages
In this step, a web scraper will download the requested contents from multiple web pages.

Step 2: Extracting Data
The data on websites is HTML and mostly unstructured. Hence, in this step, web scraper will parse and extract structured data from the downloaded contents.

Step 3: Storing the Data
Here, a web scraper will store and save the extracted data in any of the format like CSV, JSON or in database.

Step 4: Analyzing the Data
After all these steps are successfully done, the web scraper will analyze the data thus obtained.
